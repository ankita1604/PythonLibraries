# PythonLibraries
Exploratory project on different Libraries.

A Python library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to include in your programs/ projects.
Essentially, then, a library is a collection of modules. A library is a collection of related functionality, whereas a module only provides a single piece of functionality. Which means that, if you have a system with both modules and libraries, a library will typically contain multiple modules.

Here, In the small project I've tried exploring the functionalities assositated with some popular python libraries.
LIBRARIES:
1. Phonenumbers: This is a Python port of Google's libphonenumber library It supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x (in the same codebase, with no 2to3 conversion needed). 
                   Installation
Install the package phonenumbers using the below command in your command prompt.

pip install phonenumbers

2.Pywhatkit: Python offers numerous inbuilt libraries to ease our work. Among them pywhatkit is a Python library for sending WhatsApp messages at a certain time, it has          several other features too.

Following are some features of pywhatkit module:

Send WhatsApp messages.
Play a YouTube video.
Perform a Google Search.
Get information on particular topic.
In Python3 pywhatkit module will not come pre-installed, so you can install it by using the command:

pip install pywhatkit

3.PIL(Python Image Library): Python Imaging Library (expansion of PIL) is the de facto image processing package for Python language. It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images. Support for Python Imaging Library got discontinued in 2011, but a project named pillow forked the original PIL project and added Python3.x support to it. Pillow was announced as a replacement for PIL for future usage.

4. Random: 2 small projects: Dice Simulator and Random Password Generator. The random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables. It can be used perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, selecting a random elements from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc

5. Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Import the Tkinter module.

6. Pandas: Pandas has been one of the most popular and favourite data science tools used in Python programming language for data wrangling and analysis. Data is unavoidably messy in real world. And Pandas is seriously a game changer when it comes to cleaning, transforming, manipulating and analyzing data.
